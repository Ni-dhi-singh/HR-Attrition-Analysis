📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition (or turnover) is a critical HR challenge that impacts organizational performance and costs. This project analyzes employee attrition patterns using SQL + Power BI/Excel, focusing on demographic, job role, education, salary, and tenure-related factors.

The interactive dashboard provides key HR insights to help organizations reduce attrition and improve employee retention strategies.

- Does salary level or years at company affect attrition?

- Are there gender-based differences in attrition?

- Which education background employees are leaving the most?

- What is the overall attrition rate and how can it be reduced?

- The goal was to identify key drivers of attrition and provide data-driven recommendations.
